ACKNOWLEDGE POLLING: 
Once the internally timed write cycle has started and the EEPROM inputs are disabled, acknowledge polling can be initiated. 
This involves sending a start condition followed by the device address word. The read/write bit is representative of the operation desired. 
Only if the internal write cycle has completed will the EEPROM respond with a "0", allowing the read or write sequence to continue.
